-- Data --
Bytes Read				-> Total number of bytes read by the job from input files via the configured input format.
Map output bytes			-> Size in bytes of all mapper output.
Spilled Records				-> Number of records temporarily written to disk due to memory constraints (in map phase).
Combine input records			-> Records read by a combiner (if used).
Combine output records			-> Records output by a combiner.
Reduce input groups			-> Number of unique keys received by the reducer.
Reduce input records			-> Total records sent to the reducer (across all keys).
Reduce output records			-> Records emitted by the reducer as final output.
Bytes Written:				-> Total number of bytes written by Reduce to the file system (e.g. HDFS) as the final output of the job.

-- Memory --
Physical memory (bytes) snapshot	-> The sum of physical memory allocated by all active containers, in all snapshots detected by YARN during the job.
Peak Map Physical memory (bytes)	-> Maximum physical memory used by any single map task.
Peak Reduce Physical memory (bytes)	-> Maximum physical memory used by any reduce task.
